        <h1>Design Patterns</h1>
        <h3>What is a pattern?</h3>
        <p>A design pattern is a general reusable solution to common problems in software design. It is a template to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. The patterns concept originated in architecture in 1977, and was introduced as a programming concept in 1994 in the book <a href="https://sophia.javeriana.edu.co/~cbustaca/docencia/DSBP-2018-01/recursos/Erich%20Gamma,%20Richard%20Helm,%20Ralph%20Johnson,%20John%20M.%20Vlissides-Design%20Patterns_%20Elements%20of%20Reusable%20Object-Oriented%20Software%20%20-Addison-Wesley%20Professional%20(1994).pdf">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>.<br/> There are three types of patterns: 
          <ul>
            <li>Creational</li>
            <li>Structural</li>
            <li>Behavioral</li>
          </ul>
        

        </p>
        <h3>Pros / Cons</h3>
        <p>Design patterns gives the developer a tested and proven strategy for solving software problems. This can speed up development as well as mitigate future problems as the software grows larger. However design patterns can overcomplicate certain designs when used incorrectly.</p>

        <h1>Factory Method</h1>
        <h4>Also known as: Virtual Constructor</h4>
        <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method">Source</a>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>Intent</h3>
        <p>Factory Method provides an interface for creating objects in the parent class, but allows subclasses to alter the
          type of the objects that will be created.</p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>You are creating a logistics management app. First version of your app will handle only a single object, but in the
          future we will want to expand the functionality and alterations. </p>
        <p>After a while your code will be coupled with the original object and making changes will be hard.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Factory Method replaces direct object creation with a special
          <i>"factory"</i> method. The constructor should be moved inside that method. Objects returned by the factory method
          are often called
          <i>"products"</i>.</p>
        <p>May seem pointless at first, but now we can override the factory method in a subclass and change the class of the
          object that will be created.</p>
        <p>There is slight limitations: all products must have a common interface. Factory method is a base class that should
          be returning this common interface.</p>
        <p>E.g. It is like having a module object parent class and then making slight alterations in the children that inherit
          from this parent class.</p>
        <h3>Application</h3>
        <a href="https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#factorypatternjavascript">References</a>
        <p>This allows user to extend existing code as oppose to modifying. This also condenses code to produce components to
          a single creational method. We can save system resources and reuse existing objects, instead of rebuilding new
          ones.</p>

        <h3>Pros & Cons</h3>

          <!-- Table Headers -->
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <td>Pros</td>

            </tr>

            <tr scope="row">
              <td>Follows the Open/Closed Principle</td>
              <td>Requires extra subclasses.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr scope="row">
              <td>Avoids tight coupling between concrete products and code that uses them.</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>

            <tr scope="row">
              <td>Simplifies code due to moving all creational code to one place.</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>

            <tr scope="row">
              <td>Simplifies adding new products to the program.</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>

        </table>
        <h3>Relations with Other Patterns</h3>
        <p>Most designs will start with Factory Method, but slowly evolve towards Abstract Factory, Prototype, or Builder as
          designers need more flexibility.</p>
        <p>Abstract Factory classes are often implemented with Factory Methods, but also used in Prototype.</p>
        <p>Factory Method can be used along with Iterator pattern to return proper iterators based on subclass.</p>
        <p>Prototype requires initialize, but not subclassing and Factory Method is the opposite</p>
        <p>Factory Method focuses on Template Method and is often served as a step in a large Template Method.</p>
